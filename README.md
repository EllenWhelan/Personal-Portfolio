# Personal-Portfolio
A personal portfolio built in Django using a Postgresql database. Html and Css templates were sourced from Bootstrap and customised to fit my content. 

Developed to expand on Django skills and SQL skills. 

A simple site with a landing page that offers the viewer an About me, contact me and view projects section. The about me section offers some basic information about me, the contact me links my socials and the projects page showcases some college projects and links to their respective GitHub repositories.
