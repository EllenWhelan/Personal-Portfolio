# Personal-Portfolio
A personal portfolio built in Django using a Postgresql database. Html and Css templates were sourced from Bootstrap and customised to fit my content. 

Developed to expand on Django skills and SQL skills. 

A simple site with a landing page that offers the viewer an About me, contact me and view projects section. The about me section offers some basic information about me, the contact me links my socials and the projects page showcases some college projects and links to their respective GitHub repositories.

As this was only a learning exercise to explore the capabilities of Django, and was not built with the intention of using it as my professional portfolio, the pictures and details of projects is mostly made up. 

Django docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/

Bootstrap docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/

Postgresql docs:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/

The UI is similarly somewhat basic as my focus was on learning the structure of the django framework with the views and models.
